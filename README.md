# 1. What are the common distance metrics used in distance-based classification algorithms?

# Some common distance metrics include:

# Euclidean Distance: The straight-line distance between two points.
# Manhattan Distance: The sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates.
# Minkowski Distance: A generalization that includes Euclidean and Manhattan distances based on an order parameter.
# Cosine Similarity: Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors; often converted to a distance measure.
# Hamming Distance: The number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different, used for categorical or binary data.

# 2. What are some real-world applications of distance-based classification algorithms?

# The Real-world applications of distance-based classification are:

# Face and Object Recognition: Classifying faces in images and objects in scenes.
# Medical Diagnosis: Categorizing patient data or imaging results into diagnostic categories.
# Document Classification: Grouping similar documents for search or topic detection.
# Fraud Detection: Identifying unusual patterns that signify potentially fraudulent activity.
# Recommendation Systems: Finding similar users or items based on features.

# 3. Explain various distance metrics.

# Euclidean Distance: Calculates the root sum of squared differences between features. It is sensitive to the magnitudes of the variables.
# Manhattan Distance: Sums the absolute differences between features. It can be more robust to outliers than Euclidean distance.
# Minkowski Distance: Generalizes both Euclidean and Manhattan distances by introducing a parameter (p) such that when p=1, it is Manhattan, and when p=2, it is Euclidean.
# Cosine Distance (Similarity): Measures the orientation (angle) between two vectors rather than their magnitude, useful in text analysis and high-dimensional spaces.
# Hamming Distance: Counts the number of mismatches between two strings or vectors of equal length and is used for categorical or binary data.

# 4. What is the role of cross validation in model performance?

# Cross-validation is used to:

# Assess Generalizability: It provides an estimate of how well the model will perform on unseen data.
# Reduce Overfitting: By training and testing on different subsets of data, it minimizes the chance that the model is overly tuned to one particular dataset split.
# Parameter Tuning: It helps in selecting hyperparameters (like k in KNN) that give the best average performance across multiple folds.

# 5. Explain variance and bias in terms of KNN.

# Variance and Bias in terms of KNN are:

# Variance refers to the sensitivity of the model to small fluctuations in the training data. In KNN, using a very low value of k (such as 1) can lead to a very flexible decision boundary that captures noiseâ€”this results in high variance.
# Bias describes the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simplified model. A high value of k will smooth out the decision boundary, potentially ignoring subtle differences in data (high bias), but it often reduces variance.
# A good k value strikes a balance between bias and variance, reducing overfitting while still capturing important trends.
